# data-science-portfolio-projects
Here I would like to present my portfolio projects. 
One of them was compleated while taking a Data Science course on Udemy,which gave me a needed knowledge to make my own personal projects. 
In the 'Udemy keras portfolio project' I manly focuesd on the task given in the Udemy course, such us data preprocessing, data visualisation as well as builidng a deep learning model binary classification model. 
In my Youtube API projects, I explored Youtube API to get the data which I later explored in order to find some insigts about it. 
The 'Abalone linear regression project' shows my skills which can be implemented while creating a linear regression model.
There will be more projects coming in the future.
Any feedback is appreciated.
